            <p>I like to consider myself as a bit of a unicorn. Why? Because I was born and raised here in the Portland, Oregon! For twenty-eight years I've been swimming, hiking, biking, snowboarding, and driving all over the beautiful Pacific Northwest, and although I've moved around the area, I've never been too far from home.</p>
            <p>Depending on the time of year I can often be found watching football or basketball in one of the many incredible local breweries here in town. (If you've got time, <span><a href="https://www.brewvana.com/home">sign up for a tour with Brewvana.</a></span> It will be worth it!)</p>
            <p>I graduated from Clackamas High School in 2008, and Multnomah University in 2015. After working at a warehouse for two and half years, my career trajectory changed when I started at Epicodus in March of 2018. I chose to pursue front-end web development because I am passionate about creating websites that are not only functional, but are also sleek and user-friendly. I lovethe beauty of the Northwest, and it's that rustic style and sense of adventure that I bring to my development and design.</p>
